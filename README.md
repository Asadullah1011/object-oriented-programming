CRICKET GAME

We are planning to make a project on cricket game  in C++ using the concepts I have learnt and I will be learning. Using this program user can play game. There are many options in game i.e There are two  teams Pakistan and India user  his own choice which team he wants select for himself  and which he want to be opponent.





Function of my program
How can user play game. When game is started firstly there would be option come select your team i.e  Pakistan and india
Which team user select  then user  have to enter his  name to  make himself captain of that team and opponent team captain make by himself and its target as well .User can only play batting not bowling that is why the opponent team target made itself. There would be option display 1-10 which player you wants for batting user himself choose any player random for batting. When user select player for playing  and the opponent team bowler select by itself. User select batsman who would be on offstrike and captain himself would be make onstrike  then option would come select the button between 1 to 10.when batsman select any random button then its depend on luck what he score  6,4 or 1. When batsman score  a singal then players would be shuffle and also player will be shuffle when over will finish.
